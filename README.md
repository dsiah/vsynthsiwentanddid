# How to Use
Make sure you have max installed and the latest vsynth package in the package manager.
Click the green code button for the dropdown selection > choose download as zip.
Opening the maxpatch files will give you the patch and usage steps are commented in the window.


Note: You may need to load the presets manually by clicking "Read" and in the file browser choosing the file with the presets suffix that matches the patch filename
(e.g. arches.maxpatch -> "read" in the arches-presets.json)
